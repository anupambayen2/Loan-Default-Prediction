Project Summary: Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project builds a classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan based on financial and demographic features. It is part of my daily machine learning practice uploads on GitHub.

📌 Objective

To identify customers with a high probability of loan default, enabling better credit risk assessment and decision-making.

📊 Dataset

Dataset used: Default_Fin.csv

Contains customer-level financial and behavioral attributes relevant to loan repayment.

Target variable:

Default (0 = No Default, 1 = Default)

🛠️ Steps Performed

Loaded and explored the dataset

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing

Selected relevant features for prediction

Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained a classification model to predict loan default

Evaluated model performance using:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy Score

Other classification metrics

📈 Key Insight

Certain financial attributes strongly influence default behavior.

The model successfully distinguishes between defaulters and non-defaulters.

This approach can help reduce credit risk and improve loan approval strategies.

🧪 Outputs

Loan default predictions

Model evaluation metrics

Insights into key risk factors

🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world financial problems such as credit risk assessment. Predicting loan default can help financial institutions make more informed lending decisions.
